Deepak Ajwani is a postdoctoral researcher at Bell Labs in Dublin, Ireland, carrying out research on algorithms for large graphs in parallel, external and distributed computation models. In his prior appointment, he has worked as a postdoctoral researcher at IBM Research Dublin and the Centre for Unified Computing in University College Cork, Ireland. In this appointment, he worked on co-optimization of network topology configuration for optical circuit switches and partitioning, mapping and routing solutions for stream-computing applications. Prior to that, he worked at the Centre for Massive Data Algorithms, Aarhus University, Denmark. During this appointment, he worked on parallel cache-efficient algorithms for various geometric problems. He received his Ph.D. in computer science from Max-Planck-Institute for Informatics, Germany.
