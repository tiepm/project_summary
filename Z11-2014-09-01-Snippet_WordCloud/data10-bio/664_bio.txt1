HAIK MARDOYAN is a research engineer within Bell Labs Optical Networks research domain at the Centre of Villarceaux in Nozay, France. He got the diploma “Master of research in sciences and technology in fundamental physics and optronics” from University of Paris Sud, France. During his 14 years with Alcatel-Lucent, he has taken part in large-scale experiments and records in the field of wavelength division multiplexing transmissions, both terrestrial and submarine. Currently, he works for two research activities related to dynamic optical networks for metropolitan, datacenter, and access architectures. He is the first author of 1 postdeadline paper, the coauthor of 20 postdeadline papers at major conferences (Optical Fiber Communication Conference, European Conference on Optical Communication, Optical Amplifiers and their Applications Conference, OptoElectronics and Communications Conference), the coauthor of more than 70 journal and conference papers, and holds three patents. He has participated in several European and French national projects (e.g. COHDEQ40; MIRTHE; MICROS; 100GRIA; STRADE) and is currently leading the Bell Labs support for the HENIAC project funded by the “France’s Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)”. The goal of this project is to investigate “High spectral Efficiency 400G/1T Optical Networks Powered by very hIgh speed Digital-to-Analog Converters”. He is also co-leader of the PANTHER FP7 European project (“PAssive and electro-optic polymer photonics and InP electronics iNtegration for multi-flow Terabit transceivers at edge SDN switcHes and data-center gateways”) whose aim is to develop multi-flow transceivers with exceptional flexibility with a total net capacity up to 1.2 Tb/s.
