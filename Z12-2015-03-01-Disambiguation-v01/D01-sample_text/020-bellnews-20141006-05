Maria Anagnosti and Rafael Rios Müller were runners-up in the best student paper award for their papers entitled respectively “Record Gain x Bandwidth (6.1 THz) Monolithically Integrated SOA-UTC Photoreceiver for 100 Gbit/s Applications” and “Blind Receiver Skew Compensation for Long-Haul Non-Dispersion Managed Systems”, presented at the 40th European Conference on Optical Communications (ECOC) held on September 21st – 25th 2014, in Cannes France. Maria presented a best-in-class pre-amplified photoreceiver with a responsivity of 95A/W, a 3-dB bandwidth of 95GHz leading to record gain bandwidth product of 6.1THz. This is a 6x improvement compared to best results reported so far. Rafael designed an algorithm which compensates for the receiver misalignments (skew) up to 13% of the symbol period in a 46 Gbaud 16QAM transmission after 4000 km.
