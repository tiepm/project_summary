NAD: Web Latency Reduction Techniques with HTTP/2
HTTP 2 is the new version of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol expected to be published as an RFC beginning 2015. This new version promises to reduce web latency by means of request and response multiplexing, header compression, request prioritization, and server push. We measured the page load time (PLT) of HTTP 2 for 10 different popular web pages and compared with its predecessor HTTP 1.1 under varying network conditions, i.e., bandwidth, round-trip time, and packet loss. We observe a moderate (up to 20%) reduction of the page load time comparing HTTP 2 and 1.1 when the round-trip time is large. We further explored intelligent use of new HTTP 2 features including server push and request prioritization, which promise a significant reduction in user-perceived web latency. Our early results have led to 10 new patent proposals.
