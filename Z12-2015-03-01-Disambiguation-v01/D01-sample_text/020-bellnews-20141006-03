Fixed Networks and CTO CEC: Verizon Deployment of New Cost Reduced Alcatel-Lucent G-821M-A Outdoor ONT
The Compliance Engineering Center (CEC) shortened the typical test duration for a series of NEBS product compliance tests on a new Optical Network Terminal (ONT) product by more than three months. The CEC exploited the inherent design similitude of the new product (the G-821M-A ONT developed by ASB), leveraging product compliance test data from previous ONT test programs, to speed enclosure selection/qualification and to eliminate specific long duration tests (e.g., GR-950-CORE “Ultraviolet Resistance”, “Salt Fog”). Verizon will deploy the ONT in their FiOS network with an expected volume of 12,000 units per year.
